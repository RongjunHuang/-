        "<br> “Main sequence (MS) of Star-Forming Galaxies” is the correlation between the star forming rate (SFR) and stellar mass of “star forming” galaxies. This relationship evolves over cosmic time.  \n",
        "In this project, I use the code “MAGPHYS + photo - z” to build a model of spectral energy distribution (SED) of a large sample of galaxies from $0.3<z<2.1$. This code can solve 2 serious issues in previous studies: photometric redshift & SFR and stellar mass constraints (biases and uncertainty due to adopted treatment of dust attenuation). This is used to characterise the scatter in the MS and to determine the extent to which this scatter can be attributed to measurement uncertainty and/or intrinsic scatter as a function of redshift. Finally, we use this model to examine the scatter of the MS.  \n",

        "<font size=3>     \n",
        "<br> The galaxy MS describes the relationship between the SFR of galaxies and their masses (Caplar & Tacchella, 2019). The galaxy MS is significant for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Due to the long life of the galaxy, only its current life state is observed. However, the change in the MS (stellar mass and SFR) of star forming galaxies with cosmic time provides an indirect way to study galaxy evolution. The width (or scatter) of the MS at a single redshift is thought to reflect the burstiness of the star formation history. Theories suggest that a small MS width (small scatter) is indicative of gradual, continuous star formation histories whereas large MS widths (large scatter) is indicative of more bursty, stochastic star formation histories.   \n",
        "\n",
        "<br> Most of the previous studies fit the galxy SED with a fixed photometric redshift $z_{phot}$ (Caplar and Tacchella, 2019). They treat the $z_{phot}$ as a certain input so that they ignore the uncertainty of the $z_{phot}$. This introduces a systematic underestimation of the uncertainties in all distance-dependent parameters (e.g., $SFR$, $M_*$). The improvement of MAGPHYS+photo-z is to set $z_{phot}$ as an unknow quantity and find its probability distribution. Hence, the uncertainty in the $z_{phot}$ is incorporated into uncertainty in the derived physical properties of the galaxy. This allows us to examine how much of the scatter in the main sequence is driven by measurement uncertainty as opposed to true intrinsic scatter. \n",
        "\n",
        "<br> This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes how the MAGPHYS+photo-z works and mathematical principles, Section 3 shows the results...... Throughout this project, the FlatLambdaCDM model is adopted by assuming the Hubble constant is $H_0 = 70km/s /Mpc$, temperature of CMB is $T_{CMB, 0} = 2.725K$ and the mass density of the Universe is $\\Omega_{m,0} = 0.3$. Hence, for the given redshifts $0$, $0.25$, $0.5$, $1$, $2$, and $4$, the corresponding ages of the Universe are t = $13.47Gyr$, $10.53Gyr$, $8.43Gyr$, $5.75Gyr$, $3.23Gyr$, and $1.52Gyr$.\n"

        "<br> The database used in MAGPHYS+photo-z comes from two catalogs: COSMOS2020 catalog (Weaver et al. 2020) and COSMOS Super-deblended catalog (Jin et al. 2018). COSMOS2020 catalog contains photometric data for 2 million sources from UV to IR (Weaver et al. 2020) and COSMOS Super-deblended catalog presents photometric data for 194,428 galaxies from far-infrared (FIR) to sub-mm (Jin et al. 2018). We cross-match the galaxies' ID and make some selections from these two catalogs. The galaxies with 3 or more UV-nearIR bands detected at $signal-to-noise>3$ and 3 or more IR-radio bands detected at $signal-to-noise>2$ are collected to get good stellar mass and very accurate SFRs. Additionally, active galactic nuclei (AGN) is excluded by using X-ray detections and IR & radio color cuts because MAGPHYS does not include AGN models and so the derived properties are not accurate for these sources. Eventually, there are 12497 galaxies are selected as our database.\n",

        "<br> MAGPHYS+photo-z is the core code of this project. It is a galaxy SED fitting code with a wavelength range from ultraviolet to radio (da Cunha, Charlot and Elbaz, 2008). MAGPHYS+photo-z builds model libraries on different redshifts based on the required filters, and then compares the SED fitting model with the observed data to obtain the likelihood distribution of related physical parameters. Simultaneously, MAGPHYS+photo-z can predict unattenuated SED through the best fitting parameters. There are two sets of libraries used in MAGPHYS+photo-z. The optical model is for the stars and the infrared model is for the dust. These two sets of model libraries maintain the balance of the energy absorbed by dust (via attenuation in UV to near-IR) and the energy re-emitted by dust (via thermal emission in mid-IR to sub-mm).\n",
